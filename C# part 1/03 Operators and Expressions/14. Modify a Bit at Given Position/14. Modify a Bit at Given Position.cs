//Problem 14. Modify a Bit at Given Position
//• We are given an integer number  n , a bit value  v  (v=0 or 1) and a position  p .
//• Write a sequence of operators (a few lines of C# code) that modifies  n  to hold 
//the value  v  at the position  p  from the binary representation of  n  while
//preserving all other bits in  n .
