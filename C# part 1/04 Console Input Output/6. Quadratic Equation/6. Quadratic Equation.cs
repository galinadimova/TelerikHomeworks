//Problem 6. Quadratic Equation
//• Write a program that reads the coefficients  a ,  b  and  c  of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).

//Examples:
//a       b       c       roots
//2       5       -3      x1=-3; x2=0.5 
//-1      3       0       x1=3; x2=0 
//-0.5    4       -8      x1=x2=4 
//5       2       8       no real roots
