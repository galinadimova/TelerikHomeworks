//Problem 13. Binary to Decimal Number
//• Using loops write a program that converts a binary integer number to
//its decimal form.
//• The input is entered as string. The output should be a variable of type long.
//• Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.

//Examples:
//binary                          decimal
//0                               0 
//11                              3 
//1010101010101011                43691 
//1110000110000101100101000000    236476736
