//Problem 10. Odd and Even Product
//• You are given  n  integers (given in a single line, separated by a space).
//• Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal
//to the product of the even elements.
//• Elements are counted from  1  to  n , so the first element is odd, the second 
//is even, etc.

//Examples:
//numbers             result
//2 1 1 6 3           yes 
//product = 6  
  
//3 10 4 6 5 1        yes 
//product = 60  
  
//4 3 2 5 2           no 
//odd_product = 16  
//even_product = 15
